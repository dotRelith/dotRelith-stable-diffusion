This colab was inspired by and includes content from [TheLastBen/fast-stable-diffusion](https://github.com/TheLastBen/fast-stable-diffusion) and [camenduru/stable-diffusion-webui-colab](https://github.com/camenduru/stable-diffusion-webui-colab).<br>

The dotRelith-stable-diffusion(previously even-faster-stable-diffusion) notebook for Google Colab is designed to help you save space on your Google Drive. By downloading your models in a separate folder, this notebook ensures that your settings, images, extensions, etc. are not affected.<br>
Although by default, you will have to download the models every time you start the notebook. I've added a feature that allows you to download the models directly to your Google Drive if you want to. Additionally, this notebook also supports models/checkpoints from the CivitAi website, but please be aware that it hasn't been extensively tested yet.
